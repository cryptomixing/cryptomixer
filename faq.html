      <h1>FAQ</h1>

      <h2>How long does the mixing process take?</h2>
      <p>Due to the fact that our reserve is large and holds over 1.2 million dollars currently, you will not have to wait for someone else to send their coins and have your coins mixed. The mixing is often done instantly and the coins are sent back as soon as your coins come in. Ensure you send a decent amount in network fee along with the transaction to avoid coins not being sent any further due to miner rewards being low. Additionally, in order to ensure third parties do not look at fees to find similarities in the nature of transactions done by you, we permit a time delay for each forward address setup to receive the btc.</p>

      <h2>How many confirmations do you need to accept transactions?</h2>
      <p>The number of confirmations required depends on the transaction volume:
      </p><ul>
        <li>Less than 25 BTC - 1 confirmation;</li>
        <li>Less than 250 BTC - 3 confirmations;</li>
        <li>Less than 1000 BTC - 4 confirmations;</li>
        <li>More than 1000 BTC - 5 confirmations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What if I accidentally closed the browser window before getting confirmation of my transfer?</h2>
      <p>There is no need for concern. You do not have to stay at the page once the incoming address is delivered. Transfers are automatically processed according the order lot over 24 hours.</p>

      <h2>How long is incoming address valid for?</h2>
      <p>Generated addresses are valid only for about 24 hours. The data is completely deleted after the period. Future payments to the addresses are ignored.</p>

      <h2>What logs do you keep?</h2>
      <p>Logs of any nature are not maintained. We do not store any information that can be used to identify the users either. All logs are wiped out on a routine basis to add to organizational efficiency and security of the users that rely upon us to maintain their privacy.</p>

      <h2>What is the maximum transaction size?</h2>
      <p>The maximum amount of money that can be sent depends on the Bitcoin reserves within the service and the total amount of coins within the system. Due to our interests in protecting your privacy, we do not send coins that have been sent by you into our reserve. The system automatically prunes out coins that you have sent at the time of sending you the mixed coins back. If there is a limit on number of coins you can send, we notify you about it during the order process.</p>

      <h2>Is there a minimum transaction size?</h2>
      <p>Due to the nature of our operations we do not accommodate transactions that are less than .001 BTC in size. We consider the smaller transactions to be donations made to our system.</p>

      <h2>Can I trust you with large amounts of BTC?</h2>
      <p>The fact that we hold over 2000 BTC should stand testimony to the amount of skin we have in the game. Our reserves are publicly proven on BitcoinTalk (<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1484009.msg15256505#msg15256505" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1484009.msg15350012#msg15350012" target="_blank">2</a>, <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1484009.msg15428183#msg15428183" target="_blank">3</a>). We do not profit by running away with your coins but by rather running longer in the business. If you feel insecure sending large amount of coins, you have the choice of sending money over a longer period of time in a number of transactions instead. The code within the mixer ensure your coins are never mixed with your own coin and sent back. This ensures security, transparency and anonymity</p>

      <h2>What is a CryptoMixer code?</h2>
      <p>The first time you interact with our system and exchange coins, you are given a code. This code is then used to ensure your coins are not mixed with any of the previous coins sent to our reserves during future transactions. This is a key component of what allows us to ensure your privacy and safety.</p>

      <h2>What is a Letter of Guarantee?</h2>
      <p>At the time a Bitcoin address is provided to you for the sending of coins to be mixed, we provide a digitally signed confirmation to verify that the provided address was generated by our server. This helps you confirm the legitimacy of the transaction and be confident about the coins being sent to the right address. To take things further and ensure user confidence this is signed from our bitcoin account <strong>1CrypMixXWtTjYGCM5ZJmyQYP1Y39P7aLM</strong> and can be used to verify the digital sign from your own wallet.  This sign is the proof of our obligations and users are expected to save it before sending us coins. Since your data is deleted from our servers this is the only proof of us transacting with you and helps future verifications for support or related functions.</p>

      <h2>How do I verify the Letter of Guarantee?</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Head over to your Bitcoin Wallet.</li>
        <li>Choose File</li>
        <li>Select Verify Message (or Tools -&gt;Verify Message)</li>
        <li>Paste our address: 1CrypMixXWtTjYGCM5ZJmyQYP1Y39P7aLM, Letter of Guarantee as a message (copy the text inside of START/END section) and digital signature</li>
        <li>Click Verify</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Why should I set custom fee?</h2>
      <p>This is done in order to ensure your privacy and safety. In the event that someone knows your service fee, they will be able to analyse the publicly available ledger called Blockchain to see how and when your transactions were made and figure out the destination account. For example if 100 Btc is sent with a fixed fee of .5 percent + .00005 Btc a total of 99.4995 Btc would be received on the other side. For someone trying to trace your transactions it will not be difficult to keep an eye on the the fee and see what is going on. Even if multiple addresses are used we will not be able to ensure your safety due to the similarity in the nature of your transactions.</p>
